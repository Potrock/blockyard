//! Block models: blocks that aren't full cubes (torches, slabs, stairs, beds, a game's fences,
//! panes, posts and boxes), as boxes on a 1/16 grid, Minecraft style.
//!
//! Each variant's model is built once from its `ModelKind`: written facing north, then turned
//! to its facing. Textures are mapped from world position (the part of the texture under each
//! face), so a half slab shows the lower half of its texture; a face that has to show its
//! texture a particular way round (a bed's pillow toward its head) says which way its image's
//! right and up point, and turning the model turns those with it (see `uv_transform`).
//!
//! A model gives:
//! - `parts`: the boxes drawn, a texture per face;
//! - `bounds`: the boxes you aim at (and rays and sight stop at);
//! - `collide`: the boxes bodies collide with, if the block is solid: its `bounds`, but for a
//!   fence, which is 1.5 blocks high to bodies (Minecraft's), so nobody jumps it;
//! - `cover`: which parts of each of the cell's six sides it fills with opaque faces, as a 4x4
//!   grid, so a neighbour's face against a filled side isn't drawn.
//!
//! Fences and panes join what's beside them (see `joined`): each has a model for every way its
//! four sides can be joined, picked where it stands from its neighbours, so a block placed or
//! broken beside one changes it without its id changing.
