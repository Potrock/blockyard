/**
 * How the platform draws and moves the voxel fighters (`Models.gltf` options), for their chunky
 * proportions (a big head, big fists):
 *
 * - `heldScale` 0.68 (the platform's 0.52): guns big enough in those fists to read, as the voxel
 *   figures this look comes from carry them; a pistol is held as one under 0.6 m as held.
 * - The rifle at the hip and aimed held further out and lower, clear of the big head.
 * - First person: the arms life size, the fists smaller (`hands`), so the hands close on the grips
 *   with forearms of a proper thickness (the figures' own fists would fill the screen). Where the
 *   guns sit is each gun's `hold.gun` (weapons.ts).
 * - The feet as far apart as the hips.
